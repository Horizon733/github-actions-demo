# GitHub Actions Demo: Streamlining Python Code Reviews  

This repository demonstrates the use of **GitHub Actions** to automate Python code reviews. It includes workflows for:  
- **Code Quality Checks**: Enforcing PEP 8 compliance using `flake8`.  
- **Format Checking**: Ensuring type safety with `black` and `isort`.  

## How It Works  

The workflow is triggered on every pull request or push, running automated checks and providing feedback directly within the GitHub interface.  

## Usage  

Explore the repository and its workflows to understand how to integrate GitHub Actions into your Python projects for efficient code reviews.
